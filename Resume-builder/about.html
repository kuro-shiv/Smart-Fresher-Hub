    <h2>About Smart Fresher Hub</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Smart Fresher Hub</strong> is a dedicated web-based platform aimed at supporting fresh graduates, job seekers, and early-career professionals in crafting high-quality resumes that align with the requirements of modern Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Our tools and resources are designed to make the resume-building process simpler, more efficient, and results-driven.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you are applying for your first internship or your first full-time job, we provide a structured approach to resume generation that not only assists you in formatting but also in evaluating how well your resume stands up to automated HR filters.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform Features & Purpose</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ATS-Friendly Resume Generator:</strong> Our system generates resumes that are formatted for compatibility with most Applicant Tracking Systems used by recruiters. We offer pre-built templates that follow industry standards for layout, font, spacing, and keyword optimization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resume Scoring & Analysis:</strong> Upload your resume and job description to receive a real-time AI-based analysis of how closely your resume matches a specific job profile. This helps you tailor your application and improve your chances of selection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User-Centric Interface:</strong> The platform is designed with ease of use in mind. All services are accessible through a straightforward, mobile-friendly interface that requires no prior technical knowledge.

    </ul>

    <h3>Monetization & Sustainability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google AdSense Integration:</strong> To support the operational costs associated with hosting, bandwidth, and AI resource utilization, we have integrated Google AdSense. This allows non-intrusive advertisements to be displayed throughout the site, which in turn generates revenue to keep the service freely available to all users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Free of Cost to Users:</strong> Despite offering advanced resume analytics powered by AI, we do not charge any fees for using the service. All features are provided completely free of cost.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Handling & Privacy Policy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Temporary Data Storage:</strong> All data inputted into the platform, including resume details and job descriptions, is only used during your active session. The data is processed temporarily and is deleted immediately after use or after a short timeout period. No information is permanently stored on our servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Data Sharing:</strong> Under no circumstances do we sell, rent, or share your personal information or uploaded content with third parties. Your data remains entirely confidential and is handled with maximum care.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security Protocols:</strong> The platform implements standard HTTPS security for data encryption during transmission. In addition, we follow best practices to prevent unauthorized access and ensure secure handling of your session data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We make use of third-party APIs (like OpenRouter AI and SMTP.js for mailing) strictly for feature functionality. These services are used responsibly and securely.
      </li>
    </ul>
